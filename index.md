### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how To make the game hilo. 
    Hilo also introduced me to how random numbers were really generated, as well as how the game was 
    orientated. The ability to generate random numbers really opens up a window of opportunities when 
    it comes to coding.

* Lab 3 

    Lab 3 , part 1 was also one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to call a function. 
    It also helped me as I learned how to read text given within the arguements and convert them from string to 
    double or int etc. Lab 3 was a foundational lab that has given me knowledge that I couldn't miss.

*Lab 8

    Lab 8 was a fun lab that gave me a chance to work with the catch function. the try and catch function is vital when it comes
    to testing and wanting to see if code can catch what humans will miss. The instructions were very helpful and the overall feeling 
    of the code felt solid.
